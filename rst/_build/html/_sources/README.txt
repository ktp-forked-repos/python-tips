Python Tips
===========

Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of
programmers. However, not all of them are familiar with the tips and
patterns of this language. It is easy for the beginners to overlook them
and most books do not mention these tips and patterns. In this book I
aim to compile most of these tips, tricks and patterns. This way every
Python programmer will have easy access to them.

These tricks not only make your code more Pythonic but also reduce the
amount of effort required to maintain it. This book is an outcome of my
desire to have something like it when I was beginning to learn Python.

If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there
is something for you in this book.

Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you
Python. Instead it teaches you how to write beautiful Python. I am sure
you are as excited as I am so let's start!
