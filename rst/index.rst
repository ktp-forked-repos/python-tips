Python Tips
===========

============
Author
============

I am Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid. I have been programming extensively in Python for over 3 years now. I have been involved in a lot of Open Source projects. I regularly blog about interesting Python topics over at my `blog <http://www.freepythontips.wordpress.com>`_ . In 2014 I also presented at EuroPython which was held in Berlin. It is the biggest Python conference in Europe.

Preface
============

Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, not all of them are familiar with the tips and patterns of this language. It is easy for the beginners to overlook them and most books do not mention these tips and patterns. In this book I aim to compile most of these tips, tricks and patterns. This way every Python programmer will have easy access to them.

These tricks not only make your code more Pythonic but also reduce the amount of effort required to maintain it. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like it when I was beginning to learn Python.

If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book.

Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. Instead it teaches you how to write beautiful Python. I am sure you are as excited as I am so let's start!
